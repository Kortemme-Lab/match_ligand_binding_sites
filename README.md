# Match ligand binding sites
This repository contains code that extract ligand binding sites from the PDB95 database and match ligand binding sites to scaffold libraries.

To run the code, first edit the the `site_settings.json` file to point the dependent files to correct paths.

Next go to the `binding_sites_from_pdb` directory to generate the binding site database.

Then go to the `matching_binding_sites` directory to run the matching scripts.
